# TASK-2-COLLECTIONS
Please modify the program from task 1 in such a way that it does not took repetitions. Of course, make sure you have repetitions appeared in the txt file.
Ps. The point is not to create a non-accepting repetitions logic by yourselfbut just to use the right collection (I suggest HashSet).
Ps2. A set is often used to check whether a given element exists in a file/data, sets use the contains() method to check it on one of the sample employees.
